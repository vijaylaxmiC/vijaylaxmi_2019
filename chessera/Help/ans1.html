		"q":"What are the rules to be followed while playing chess?",
		"a":"<p><b>Setup:</b>The board is setup as shown. The board should have a white square at the closest right-hand side"+
			"for both the players.Remember that the queen must be on a square that matches her colour.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Turns:</b>White always moves first and players alternate their turns. Players can only move one piece at a time, except when castling </p>"+
			"<p><b>Taking Pieces:</b>Players take pieces when they encounter an opponent in their movement path. Only pawns take differently"+
			"than they move Players cannot take or move through their own pieces.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Pawn movement:</b>Pawns only move forward. On the first move a pawn can move one or two spaces; every subsequent move "+
			"can only be one space. Pawns move diagonally to take opponents.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Pawn Promotion:</b>If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board,it is promoted to a higher piece (except king)."+
			"There is no limit on the number of pawns that can be promoted.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Rook:</b>Rooks move in a continuous straight line forward, backward and side-to-side.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Knight:</b>Knights are the only pieces that jump off the board. Unlike other pieces they are not blocked"+
			"if there are pieces between them and their destination square.To make it easier to remember as to how a knight"+
			"moves think of the alphabet ‘L’. Two spaces in a direction forward, backward or side-to-side, and one space at a right turn.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Bishop:</b> Bishops move in continuous diagonal lines in any direction.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Queen:</b> The queen moves in continuous diagonal and straight linesforward, backward and side-to-side.</p>"+
			"<p><b>King:</b>The king can move in any direction, one square at a time. A king cannot move to a square that is under attack by the opponent.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Castling:</b> Castling is the only move that allows two pieces to move during the same turn. During castling a king moves two spaces towards the rook "+
			"that it will castle with, and the rook jumps to the other side. The king can castle to either side as long as:"+
			"<p>1.The king has not moved.</p> <p>2.The king is not in check.</p> <p>3.The king is not in check.</p>"+
			"<p>4.There are no pieces between the king and castling-side rook.</p> <p>5.The castling-side rook has not moved."+
			"<p>It does not matter:</p><p>1.If the king was in check, but is no longer.</p><p>2.If the rook can be attacked by an opponent's piece before castling.</p>"+
			"<p><b>En Passant:</b> En passant is a special movement for pawns attacking pawns. It only applies if your opponent moves a pawn two spaces and its destination space is next to your pawn.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Check:</b>A king is in check when an opponent's piece is in a position that can attack the king. A player must move their king out of check, block the check or capture the attacking piece.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Check mate:</b>Putting an opponent's king in checkmate is the only way to win the game. A king is in checkmate if it is "+
			"in check. The opponent's piece that has the king in check cannot be captured, the check cannot be blocked and the king cannot"+
			"move to a square that is not under attack.In the illustration the white queen has the black king in check"+
			"and all of the spaces where the king can move can be attacked by the queen. The king cannot take the queen, because"+
			"the knight is protecting the queen. The black bishop cannot block the queen. This is checkmate."+
			"<p><b>Stalemate:</b> Stalemate is a tie. It is achieved if there are no legal moves for a player to make. In this illustration"+
			"it is white's turn. All spaces around the king are being attacked, but the king is not in check, therefore it cannot move. The only other white piece, the pawn, is blocked by the king. Because movement is impossible, the game is a stalemate."+
			"If white had another piece somewhere on the board that was not blocked, it would have to move and the game would continue.</p>"+
			"<p><b>Basic Strategy:</b> Chess is an incredibly complex strategic game and it is impossible to get into all the possible tactics that could be used  to win. However, I wanted to leave the new player with a few hints that will hopefully aid in victory."+
			"<p><b>Piece Value:</b>It is quite obvious that you would want to protect your pieces from capture. ITo avoid the capture you should know which pieces are the strongest. This help you in a situation where you need to choose between two pieces. A good explanation of piece value is available on Wikipedia."+
			"<p>Queen: Strongest = High Value</p><p></p>Rook <p>Bishop, Knight</p> <p>Pawn: Weakest = Least Value</p>"+
			"The bishop and the knight are commonly considered equal on the value scale, However many feel (including me) that the bishop has a slight edge over the knight."+
			"Pawns are valued more as they near promotion.<p><b>Pawn Promotion:</b> A pawn can be promoted to a variety of pieces, but the strongest choice is always to promote to queen which has an added advantage."+
			"Board Control: When building defence, remember to look at the board and analyse your strength in certain areas of the board. Try and keep the power distributed fairly and evenly. Try and bring pieces over to add strength if you forsee an attack.</p>"+
			"When you plan an attack, it's a bad idea to let any of your pieces being cut off from your main force. I find it helpful to have a support piece in mind when planning an attack."+ 
			"Using pieces in tandem almost always yields a better result when compared to using one piece alone."
